PlayerLazer functions added: 
	reset()
	getters/setters for private data member (bool) "fired" which makes it 
		...impossible for more than one playerLazer instance to be in play at any one time.

main function altered
	the playerLazer instance will be reset when it moves past the top of the SDL window.

TODO: allow multiple lazers to be fired before resetting, and then reuse the instances once they've been reset
