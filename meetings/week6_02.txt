Today I reduced the code repitition problem from the player lazer implementation (from 100 lines to about 15).
I also changed the static alien textures to animated sprite clips,
and added collision detection between the player lazers and alien invaders.
Still need to add explosions and remove alien instances upon collision.
I seem to be getting the hang of things here.
It might be necessary to change from arrays to vectors, 
but I'll deal with that when it becomes a problem.
There were many commits to my public github repository today,
but this is my first update to the bitbucket repo today.
TODO's: Animate player space craft in the same way I created the animated alien texture.
	Add additional enemy types.
	Destroy alien instances upon collision with player lazer.
	Create explosion texture which appears briefly before dissappearing, occuring after a collision between player lazer and alien.
	Allow enemies to fire back.
	Allow enemies to increase horizontal movement speed, and drop down towards the player.
	Allow enemies to collide with player space craft once they reach the bottom 'row'.
	Redraw player space craft image texture.
	Redraw player lazer image texture.
	Create an alien lazer image texture.
	Think about adding score counter, game menus, additional levels/difficulties.
	The list goes on.......
