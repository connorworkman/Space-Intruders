The object of this game is to destroy all alien intruders before they reach Earth (the bottom of the screen) while avoiding death by enemy lazers. The enemy hord will advance toward Earth every time any alien in the hord hits a wall (a hint that you should prioritize taking out entire columns of aliens).
